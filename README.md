# 📈 Matplotlib Visualization Project: Gas Prices & FIFA Stats  
This project demonstrates the power of **Matplotlib** for storytelling with data by visualizing two real-world datasets—gas prices across countries and FIFA 2018 player statistics. Implemented in **Jupyter Notebook**, it showcases the versatility of line charts, histograms, pie charts, and boxplots for trend, distribution, and comparison analysis.

---

## 📊 Project Overview  
The goal was to practice and apply **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques using Matplotlib, with a focus on visual clarity, clean formatting, and comparative insights. The project helps users understand market trends in fuel pricing and performance distribution among FIFA players.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python** – for scripting and data handling  
- **pandas** – for data cleaning and transformation  
- **Matplotlib** – for creating a range of data visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for step-by-step analysis and presentation

## 📌 Visualization Highlights  

### 🔹 Gas Price Analysis  
- **Line Chart** – Trend lines from 1990 to 2018 for US, UK, Canada, South Korea  
- **Insight** – Revealed price volatility, inflation impact, and cross-country differences  

### 🔹 FIFA Player Stats (2018)  
- **Histogram** – Skill level distribution of players  
  - *Insight:* Most players clustered between scores of 60 and 80  
- **Simple Pie Chart** – Dominant foot breakdown  
  - *Insight:* ~80% of players are right-footed  
- **Advanced Pie Chart** – Weight category analysis  
  - *Insight:* Most players weighed between 150–175 lbs  
- **Boxplot** – Overall fitness comparison of three national teams  
  - *Insight:* Clear differences in conditioning and consistency among teams
