# 📈 Matplotlib Visualization Project: Gas Prices & FIFA Stats

This project uses **Matplotlib** to create compelling visualizations from two real-world datasets: historical gas prices across countries and FIFA 2018 player statistics. Implemented in **Jupyter Notebook**, it explores trends, distributions, and comparisons through various plot types to demonstrate the power of data storytelling with Python.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective was to analyze and visualize data using **Matplotlib**, focusing on price fluctuations in the gas market and performance indicators in FIFA player statistics. This project was designed to solidify understanding of core chart types and how to extract insights visually.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** – for data analysis and scripting  
- **Matplotlib** – for creating charts and visualizations  
- **pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive development and presentation

## 📌 Visualization Highlights

### 🔹 Gas Price Analysis
- **Line Chart**: Visualized gas price trends from 1990 to 2018 for the US, UK, Canada, and South Korea  
- **Insight**: Revealed inflation-adjusted price changes and year-to-year volatility between countries

### 🔹 FIFA Player Statistics (2018)
- **Histogram**: Showed distribution of player skill levels  
  - *Insight*: Most players scored between 60 and 80, highlighting skill clustering  
- **Simple Pie Chart**: Visualized player dominant foot (Right vs Left)  
  - *Insight*: Approximately 80% of players are right-footed  
- **Advanced Pie Chart**: Illustrated player weight category distribution  
  - *Insight*: Majority fell between 150–175 lbs  
- **Boxplot**: Compared overall fitness of three top national teams  
  - *Insight*: Highlighted differences in team consistency and player conditioning
